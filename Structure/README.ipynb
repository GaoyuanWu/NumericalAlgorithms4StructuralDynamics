    "## Introduction\n",
    "This solver is cabaple of solving structural dynamics problem for 2D frame system. The input can be continuous function or discrete data points such as ground motion records.\n",
    "For spatial discretizatioin, lumped-mass method and finite-element-method can be used.\n",
    "For time integration, there are 4 methods to choose from:\n",
    "1. Strong-stability-preserving Runge-Kutta(3 stage, $3^{rd}$ order)\n",
    "2. Wilson-$\\theta$ method\n",
    "3. Newmark-$\\beta$ method\n",
    "4. Bathe method (first stage at t + 0.5$\\Delta t$)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage\n",
    "This solver is tested with Python 3.7.\n",
    "Numpy is needed to implement this solver.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initial structure and 1D mesh\n",
    "First, import the package `get1DMesh.py` as `mesh`.\n",
    "Then, specify the initial structural shape by constructing a 2D array `Ini_nodecoord` representing the nodes' coordinates and another 2D array\n",
    "`B` for connectivity matix. `h` is the int object for the mesh size.\n",
    "Each row of `Ini_nodecoord` represents each node, where the first column stands for x-coordinate and the second is for y-coordinate.\n",
    "Each row of `B` represents each element, where the first column is for the starting node index, and the secon is end node index. The entry in `B` is in physical sense (starts from 1, not zero).  \n",
    "`mesh.get1DMesh(Ini_nodecoord,B,h)` returns:\n",
    "1. `New_coord`, 2D array\n",
    "2. `New_B`, 2D array\n",
    "3. `Ini_to_new`, 2D array, the first column for old/original node, the second for new node index\n",
    "4. `Ini_to_new_ele`, 2D array, the first for new element index, the second for old element index\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rendering\n",
    "Import `getPlot.py` as `render`.\n",
    "`render.getPlot(coord,B,show_ele_tag = None,show_node_tag = None,tag_size = 5,fig_size = (14,14),tag_marker = 'o')` helps you to generate a plot for any given structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### FEM\n",
    "Import `getMK.py` as `getMK`.\n",
    "Construct 1D arrays for structural parameters of mass per unit length, Young's modulus, cross sectional area and moment of inertia.\n",
    "The dimension is the same as element number after mesh.\n",
    "`getMK_FEM(joint_coord,B,ele_m,ele_E,ele_A,ele_I)` returns\n",
    "1. Global stiffness matrix, 2D array\n",
    "2. Global mass matrix, 2D array\n",
    "\n",
    "### Boundary condions\n",
    "Import `getBC` as `getBC`.\n",
    "`bc` is a dictionary storing initial node index and the node's constraints.\n",
    "key:value -> key is initial node index in python, value is 1 for fixed BC, 2 for pinned and 3 for roller support.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```js\n",
    "#Node 1-4 are fixed\n",
    "bc = {0:1,1:1,2:1,3:1} \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`getBC.MK_Reduction(M,K,bc,ini_to_new)` returns:\n",
    "1. `M_bc,K_bc`, 2D array new mass matrix and stiffness matrix where first `act_num` rows for active dofs.\n",
    "2. `inact_num`, integer, `act_num` can be obtained by `K_bc.shape[0] - inact_num`\n",
    "3. `glb_to_bc`, 2D array, represents the transformation from global matrix to matrix afer imposing boundary condtions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time integration\n",
    "Before implementing the time integration. One needs to define the function for external loading.\n",
    "For functional input, below is an example:\n",
    "```js\n",
    "#Test External loading 1: acting on node 9 (8 in py), postive x direction\n",
    "def f1(x):\n",
    "    return 1000\n",
    "f1_ini_node = 8 #node on which the load applies\n",
    "f1_dof_index = 0 #0 for x, 1 for y, 2 for rz\n",
    "\n",
    "def test_f(x,itn = itn,glb_to_bc = glb_to_bc,f = f1,f_ini_node = f1_ini_node,dof_index = f1_dof_index,act_num = act_num):\n",
    "        f_list = np.array([[f,glb_to_bc[itn[f1_ini_node]*3 + dof_index]]])\n",
    "        vec = np.zeros(act_num)\n",
    "        for i in range(f_list.shape[0]):\n",
    "            pos = f_list[i,1]\n",
    "            vec[pos] = f_list[i,0](x)\n",
    "        return vec \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For ground motion records, below is an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "#Test External loading 2: earthquake\n",
    "\n",
    "GM_tab = pd.read_excel('GM.xlsx')\n",
    "GM_data = np.array(GM_tab.values) #1D array, acceleration\n",
    "dt_ft = 0.005 #Time interval of the record\n",
    "\n",
    "def test_gm(M_a,act_num = act_num,GM_data = GM_data):\n",
    "        return - M_a @ (np.ones((act_num,1))@(GM_data.T))\n",
    "    test_f2 = test_gm(M_a)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Afterwards, we are ready to implement the the time integration. Import corresponding `.py` file from `TimeIntegration` folder.\n",
    "Take Newmark-$\\beta$ method as an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "# u_0 and v_0 are 1D arrays for inital conditions\n",
    "# t_a is the starting time\n",
    "# N,h are number of steps and grid size for time integration\n",
    "# dt_ft is 0 for functional input, and is identical to the time interval fo ground motion input \n",
    "\n",
    "import Newmark as NM\n",
    "u_t,v_t,a_t = NM.Newmark_beta(delta,beta,K_a,M_a,C_a,test_f2,u_0,v_0,t_a,N,h,dt_ft = 0) # Returns the time-history\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "To better understand how the solver works, you can run `SDOF.py` and `MDOF_FEM.py` files in `Structure` folder.\n",
    "Make sure to add you path to the system and replace the corresponding scripts with `sys.path.append('your path/NumericalAlgorithms4StructuralDynamics/Structure'),\n",
    "sys.path.append('your path/NumericalAlgorithms4StructuralDynamics/TimeIntegration')`"
